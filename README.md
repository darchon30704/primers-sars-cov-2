This is a reenactment of the following paper: "Classification and specific primer design for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 using deep learning"

Utilized positional filters and CNN to identify promising primer sets for the covid-19 virus from 553 sequences from the National Genomics Data Center repository, separating the genome of different virus strains from the Coronavirus family with 98.73% accuracy.
